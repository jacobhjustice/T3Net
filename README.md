# What is T3Net?
A multiplayer web appliation of tic tac toe, with a twist.
Like tic tac toe, you have a 3x3 grid of squares, except this grid is filled with 3x3 tic tac toe cells. By winning a game within the square (by getting 3 cells in a row), you obtain that square in the outer grid. If you obtain 3 squares in a row, you win the game.
You have to be careful of which cell you chose to play in, because the cell that you pic dictates which square your opponent will play in next turn.

This is a game that some friends and I played in highschool, and I was bored, so figured it would be fun to make it myself for others to see and learn.
This repository includes everything included in the application except for a secret.php file containing credentials for the database.
